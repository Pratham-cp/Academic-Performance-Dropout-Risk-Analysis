# Academic Performance & Dropout Risk Analysis

This project analyzes student academic performance and dropout risk using
machine learning and interactive data visualization.

## Overview
The system explores relationships between academic scores, attendance,
study behavior, and final performance. A machine learning model is trained
to predict final grades and categorize students into risk levels.


## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and feature selection using Python
- Grade prediction using Random Forest Regressor
- Risk classification based on final grade thresholds
- Interactive analysis using Streamlit

## Features
- Data preview and exploration
- Subject-wise grade correlation analysis
- Attendance vs performance visualization
- Student-level grade and risk prediction
- Feature importance analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Notes
- Dataset and trained models are not included due to licensing constraints
- This project is intended for academic and research demonstration
